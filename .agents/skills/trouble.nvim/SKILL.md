# Trouble.nvim API Reference

This file is generated for plugin `folke/trouble.nvim` and module `trouble`.
Use it as a fast API/command index before reading source.

## Commands (`:`) added after force-load

_No new user commands detected from runtime diff._

## Module API (`trouble`)

```lua
require("trouble") -- table
require("trouble").setup(opts)
```

## Harder Calls (quick notes)

These calls are likely harder to wire correctly because they often have broader argument contracts, stateful behavior, or side effects.
Before using them in mappings/autocmds, confirm expected inputs and return/error behavior in `:help trouble`, the local README, and the GitHub README listed below.

- `require("trouble").setup(opts)`
