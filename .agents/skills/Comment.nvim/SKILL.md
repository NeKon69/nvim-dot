# Comment.nvim API Reference

This file is generated for plugin `numToStr/Comment.nvim` and module `Comment`.
Use it as a fast API/command index before reading source.

## Commands (`:`) added after force-load

_No new user commands detected from runtime diff._

## Module API (`Comment`)

```lua
require("Comment") -- table
require("Comment").setup(config)
```

## Harder Calls (quick notes)

These calls are likely harder to wire correctly because they often have broader argument contracts, stateful behavior, or side effects.
Before using them in mappings/autocmds, confirm expected inputs and return/error behavior in `:help Comment`, the local README, and the GitHub README listed below.

- `require("Comment").setup(config)`
