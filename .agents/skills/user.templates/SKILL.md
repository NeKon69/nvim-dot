## Commands (`:`) detected in file

_No user commands detected in static scan._

## Module API (`user.templates`)

require("user.templates").create_from_template()

```

## Harder Calls (quick notes)

These calls are likely harder to wire correctly because they often have broader argument contracts, stateful behavior, or side effects.
Before wiring them into keymaps/autocmds, verify expected input/output behavior in local code and related docs/skills.
