# Cmp-buffer API Reference

This file is generated for plugin `hrsh7th/cmp-buffer` and module `cmp_buffer`.
Use it as a fast API/command index before reading source.

## Commands (`:`) added after force-load

_No new user commands detected from runtime diff._

## Module API (`cmp_buffer`)

```lua
require("cmp_buffer") -- table
require("cmp_buffer").buffers -- table
```

## Harder Calls (quick notes)

These calls are likely harder to wire correctly because they often have broader argument contracts, stateful behavior, or side effects.
Before using them in mappings/autocmds, confirm expected inputs and return/error behavior in `:help cmp_buffer`, the local README, and the GitHub README listed below.

_No function exports detected._
